## ‚ö°Ô∏è Installation
### Method 1

Linux/Mac users can download hydra using the executing the following command in bash:

```bash
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Shravan-1908/hydra/main/linux_install.sh | sudo bash -
```

For Windows users:

Open powershell as Admin and execute the following command:
```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force; (Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Shravan-1908/hydra/main/windows_install.ps1 -UseBasicParsing).Content | powershell -
```

To verify installation of *hydra*, open a new shell and execute `hydra -v`. You should see output like this:
```
hydra 2.0.0

Version: 2.0.0
```
If the output isn't something like this, you need to repeat the above steps carefully.


### Method 2
If you've Go installed on your system, execute:

`go get github.com/Shravan-1908/hydra`

You don't need to change the PATH variable in this case, as Go will automatically build and add the executable in the $GOPATH/bin directory.

## üí° Usage
This section shows how you can use *hydra*.

### config
The `config` command is used to set or alter the hydra user configurations.

`$ hydra config {flags}`

The valid flags for config command are:
- `name` --> The name of the user.
It is used as the name of the copyright holder in the LICENSE file.

- `github-username` --> The Github username of the user.
It is used to initiate the modules in go.

- `default-lang` --> The default language for project initialisation. It is used in case the `lang` argument is not provided in the `init` command. Valid options for the `default-lang` flag are:
    * go
    * python
    * web

- `default-license` --> The default license for project creation. Valid values are:
    * MIT
    * GPL
    * BSD
    * APACHE
    * EPL
    * MPL

Once hydra is installed, it is advised to run the following command to complete the configuration.

`$ hydra config --name "YOUR NAME" --github-username "YOUR GITHUB USERNAME"`


### list
The `list` command is used to list supported languages, licenses and the hydra user configurations.

`$ hydra list <item>`

Valid options for the `item` argument are:
- langs --> Languages supported by hydra
- licenses --> Licenses supported by hydra
- configs --> The hydra user configurations

Example: `hydra list langs`

### init
To create a new project structure using *hydra*,
execute:

`$ hydra init <project name> [lang]`

The `init` command initialises the project.


Valid options for the language argument are:
- python
- go
- web

Example: `hydra init myProject python`

In case the `lang` argument is not provided, hydra falls back to the `default-lang` configuration.

*hydra* currently supports only python, go and web-frontend for project creation. But, as new versions are released, support for more languages/frameworks will be added.


### version
`$ hydra version`

The version command shows the version of *hydra* installed.

### help
`$ hydra help`

Renders assistance for *hydra* on a terminal, briefly showing its usage.
